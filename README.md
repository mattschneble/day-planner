## Description 

This project was assigned to me to create a day planner/scheduler to help view the events that are scheduled for the day. The planner utilizes bootstrap to help simplify development and styling, as well as JavaScrip to add functionality.

## Usage 

This page is to be used to track your schedule for the current day. Past hours will be one color (red), the current hour will have a second color (grey), and the future hours will be a third color (green).

## Learning Points 

Throughout the development of this program I was able to develop my JavaScript, JQuery and bootstrap skills including (but not limited to): functions, bootstrap HTML to make it easier to apply CSS styling, transversing a website by use of the DOM, localStorage, DayJS() and more.
